#BGP
-- BGP is the Border gateway protocol that uses the PATH VECTOR PROTOCOL to calculate routes to destinations
-- PATH VECTOR PROTOCOL defines a route as a pairing between a destination and the attributes to the path to that destination
-- BGP is an EGP (Exterior Gateway protocol) that links different autonomous networks together
-- OSPF is an IGP (Interior gateway protocol) that is used for routing within a single network
-- BGP is the main protocol used in implementing MLPS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)
-- BGP uses TCP (TCP keep-alive, TCP-handshake e.t.c)

e.g
12.6.126.0/24 207.126.96.43 1021 0    6461 7018 6337 11268 i

-> 6464 7018 6337 11268 } These are AS numbers of being advertised by the BGP session example above


#Key terms
- Transit - A network operator allows traffic to pass through their network destined for the internet for a free.
e.g. Simbanet sells transit access to Angani so that Angani uses its UPSTEAM transit to get to the internet

- Peering - This is the process of exchanging routing information and traffic
- Default - This determines where traffic is sent when there is no explicit matchin the routing table

#Creating a BGP Peering
-- en
-- conf t
-- router bgp {AS_NUMBER}
-- neigbor {IP_ADDR_TO_NEIGHBOR} remote-as {NEIGHBOR_AS_NUMBER}

#Advertising routes
== TO ADVERTISE, ensure that you are giving BGP the exact prefixes available in the router's routing table with the correct MASK
e.g.

-- en 
-- conf t
-- router bgp 65000
-- network 1.1.1.1 mask 255.255.255.255 # This is essentially 1.1.1.1/32 NOT WILDCARDS
-- network 10.12.0.0 mask 255.255.255.0 

#BGP Command
-- show ip bgp
-- show ip bgp summary
-- show ip protocols
