#using grep efficiently

-- grep -vi {pattern} #this removes all lines matching a pattern

#To SPECIFIC MATCHES

-- grep -oiE 'regex' file_name
e.g grep -oiE '<title>(.*)</title>' filename 

The above will look through the file and ONLY return  lines that meet the criteria

-- grep -hE "^< " * 

==> The above line checks for lines that start with < and then followed by a space
