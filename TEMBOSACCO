-- Ping 192.168.25.10 	# Mikrotik on the Tembo Sacco end
-- If it successful, the tunnel is UP


/***
For Tembo, I normally check if pptp interface is up, ppp0, if not it means tunnel is down. You need to contact Tembo team if that's the case
If tunnel is up, check if there is a default route for their 192.168.25.x subnet, if not add it (There's a cron that checks this, so it will not be an issue)
If both check out it means tunnel is up and you should be able to ping 192.168.25.10
