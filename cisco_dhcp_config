#DHCP Process
-- There is a process called  DORA
D - Discover; the client sends out a broadcast message over the network looking for the DHCP server
O - Offer; the DHCP server responds with an offer of an IP appropriate for the network, the duration of the lease, 
R - Request; the client then sends a request broadcast to the server requesting the offered IP
A - Acknowledgement; the server responds to the client request with the IP, lease duration, and other config details

#DHCP relay

-- In most cases, a DHCP server will not reside in the same subnet as the requesting client
-- DHCP relays come to the rescue; these appliances listen for any Discover messages on their network, repackages the request and ships it off to the appropriate DHCP server
-- The network appliance can be a router or a L3 switch on either the interface or SVI depending on the appliance
		== COMMAND ==
-- en
-- conf t
-- int g0/0/0 OR (SVI: int vlan 20)
-- ip helper-address {IP_ADDR_FOR_DHCP_SERVER}

#Creating a DHCP server

-- Make sure that the server is set up in the right VLAN
-- Go to config tab > Settings > Default gateway: the server gateway (192.168.1.1) > DNS: (The DHCP server IP)
-- Go to config tab > Interface > FastEthernet > give the correct IP and Mask address
-- Go to services tab > DHCP > Service: ON
-- Pool name: VLAN10
-- Default gateway: {Gateway of the VLAN subnet e.g. 172.16.10.1}
-- DNS Server: This is the DNS server IP
-- Starting IP: this is the IP from which the DHCP will start giving out IPs e.g. 172.16.10.10
-- Subnet Mask: mask of the VLAN subnet e.g. 255.255.255.0
-- Maximum Number f=of users: {A number that best captures number of clients in the network e.g. 10}
-- Leave the rest as default > Add
