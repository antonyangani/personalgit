#OSPF
-- OSPF stands for Open Shortest Path First
-- It uses the SPF (Shortest Path First or Dijkstra's algorithm)
-- It uses the concept of AREAS with area 0 being the backbone on which all other areas connect to
-- OSPF uses hello messages to find neighbors within its area
-- each router with OSPF enabled has an LSA (Link State Advertisement) which contains all the routes it has learned from its neighbors
-- LSAs are stored in an LSDB (Link State Database)

#OSPF Process

1. Hello - Neighbor discovery and maintenace
2. DBD (database description) - Summary of the LSDB of the router, and checks if the LSDBs of connected routers are the same
3. Link0State Request (LSR)- Requests specific LSAs from the neighbor
4. Link-State update (LSU)- Sends specific LSAs to requesting neigbor 
5. Link-State Acknowledgement (LSAck) - Used to acknowledge that a router has received a message

#Configuring OSPF
Log into R1
-- en
-- conf t
-- router ospf 1
-- network 10.0.12.0 0.0.0.3 area 0 # Tells router on which interfaces to activate OSPF on, e.g. 10.0.12.0 subnet with /31 wilcard 
-- network 10.0.13.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
-- network 172.16.1.0 0.0.0.15 area 0  # Tells router on which interfaces to activate OSPF on, e.g. 10.0.12.0 subnet with /28 wilcard

## IMPORTANT ##

-- You have to add networks already attached to the router is you wish them to be advertised on LSA
e.g.

-- If R1 has three interfaces, two to neighboring routers and one to a Local Lan with subnet 62.12.119.0/24, you need to make that explicit in R1 ospf advertsement
-- network 62.12.119.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
-- This will be propagated to neigboring routers which will now know how to reach the subnet

#DEFAULT OSPF ROUTE
== When one of the routers is connecting to the internet or having a BGP peering, you need to have a default route
== Any Device within the area that would like to reach an IP on the internet but doesn't have a route to it will use the default route which has been propagated by OSPF

-- Create a default route in the appropriate router that is facing the internet
-- en
-- conf t
-- ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 {interface} e.g. ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 g0/0/0
-- router ospf 1
-- default-information originate # This will propagate the information to other routers in the area 

#Passive interfaces {These are interfaces that will not advertise LSA table out of their interface}

-- en
-- conf t
-- router ospf 1
-- passive-interface g0/0/1

#Checking OSPF configs
-- en
-- show ip ospf neighbors # The routers connected share hello messages through a multicast address of 244.0.0.5 for 10 secs
-- show ip ospf interface brief

#CALCULATE WILDCARD MASKS 

== /28
== NETMASK = 32 - 28 = 4
== 2^4 = 16
== 256 - 16 = 240
== /28 NETMASK = 255.255.255.240

WILDCARD MASK = 255.255.255.255 
		- 
		255.255.255.240
		---------------
		0    0   0   15

NB: /28 wilcard netmask = 0.0.0.15

#Checking configs 
-- show ip protols
-- under OSPF check for "It is an autonomous system boundary router" meaning that the router connects the OSPF area to the internet

#Configuring Default route to the internet
-- ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 {IP_TO_INTERNET_INTERFACE}
-- router ospf 1
-- default-information originate

#OSPF-COST
-- The concept of cost is calculated based on an interface's bandwidth
FORMULA:

COST = reference bandwidth/interface bandwidth

Standard reference bandwidth = 100mbps

e.g.

Interface bandwidth = 10mbps
COST = 100/10 = 10

NB: ANY value less than 1 is converted to 1

e.g

interface bandwidth = 10Gbps
COST = 100/10000 = 0.01 BUT OSPF Cost in this case will be: 1

		==CHANGING OSPF_COST==
-- auto-cost reference-bandwidth 10000  #The value is in mbps
