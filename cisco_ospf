#OSPF
-- OSPF stands for Open Shortest Path First
-- It uses the SPF (Shortest Path First or Dijkstra's algorithm)
-- It uses the concept of AREAS with area 0 being the backbone on which all other areas connect to
-- OSPF uses hello messages to find neighbors within its area
-- each router with OSPF enabled has an LSA (Link State Advertisement) which contains all the routes it has learned from its neighbors
-- LSAs are stored in an LSDB (Link State Database)

#Configuring OSPF
Log into R1
-- en
-- conf t
-- router ospf 1
-- network 10.0.12.0 0.0.0.3 area 0 # Tells OSPF to look for networks within the 10.0.12.0 subnet with /28 wilcard 
-- network 10.0.13.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
-- network 172.16.1.0 0.0.0.15 area 0

#Checking configs 
-- show ip protols
-- under OSPF check for "It is an autonomous system boundary router" meaning that the router connects the OSPF area to the internet
