## Checing if you are almost running out of memory

-- grep -iER 'MemTotal|Committed_AS:' /pro/meminfo
-- grep -iER 'MemTotal|Committed_AS:' /pro/meminfo | awk '{print $2 / 1024 / 1024 }'

Ensure that Committed_AS is NOT greated that MemTotal!!!

## Remove Caches/Buffers
# VALUES
= 1	- 	Clear PageCache only  (PageCache is anything the OS would rather have on memory than to read from a file)

= 3	-	clear PageCache, dentries, and inodes
		Inodes are data structures which provide a representation of a file

# Clear PageCache

-- sync; echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches 

# Clear dentries and Inodes

-- sync; echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches 

# Clear PageCache, dentries, and Inodes

-- sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
