# Creating a Docker Swarm Cluster
-- Ensure you have at least 2 servers configured with docker so that one can act as the master and the other as the slave

== CHOOSE ONE SERVER TO ACT AS MASTER
-- Login to master
-- docker swarm init 
==> The result: docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-2f30c7fqwh6nf6jphgbndnhqm7v2lbrxa0g389oklt4t1y0gep-12zaam0s2xhn0koml88wb88n6 23.239.29.253:2377

# SLAVE

-- copy the above code and paste into the other servers you wish to add to the cluster

# CHECK NODES

-- Login to Master
-- docker nodes ls # This will display all nodes on the cluster with master INDICATED as LEADER

# DEPLOYING AN APP

-- docker service create --name {NAME_OF_SERVICE} --replicas {NUMBER_OF_REPLICAS} -p {HOST_POST:CONTAINER_PORT}  {IMAGE_NAME}

E.G.

-- docker service create --name uploader --replicas 3 -p 8000:8000 groctech/video-uploader
-- docker service ps {SERVICE_NAME} 			# This command will show the containers and where they are running

# SCALING CLUSTER

-- docker service scale {SERVICE_NAME}={NUMBER_OF_REPLICAS}
 E.G.
-- docker service scale uploader=2 			# This will reduce the number of replicas to 2 
-- docker service ps {SERVICE_NAME} 			# This command will show that the number of containers has reduced to 2

E.G.

-- docker service ps uploader


# INSPECTING

-- docker inspect --pretty {SERVICE_NAME}

E.G.

-- docker inspect --pretty uploader

# REMOVING A SERVICE 

-- docker service rm {SERVICE_NAME}

E.G.

-- docker service rm uploader  				# This command clears all the containers built under the swarm service
