. - matches any character Except a new line
\d - Digits (0-9)
\D - NOT a digit (0-9)
\w - matches word characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9)
_) - 
\W - matches anything NOT a word character
\s - matches whitespace (space, tabs, newlines)
\S - Matches NONE whitespace 

Anchors

\b - word boundaries
\B - NOT word boundaries
^ - Beginning of string
$ - End of string



example

\d\d\d-\d\d\d.\d\d\d\d => this matches numbers like 555.555.5555 or 555-555-5555 555*555*5555
\d\d\d[-.]\d\d\d[-.]\d\d\d\d => This matches number that have a . or a - as a separator ONLY 555.555.5555 or 555-555-5555 

If you want to match only numbers starting with an 8 or 9

[89]00[-.]\d\d\d[-.]\d\d\d\d => This will match any number starting with an 8 or 9 followed by 00 
[1-7]00[-.]\d\d\d[-.]\d\d\d\d => This will match numbers starting from 1 through to 7
[a-z A-Z]00[-.]\d\d\d[-.]\d\d\d\d

Quantifiers

* - 0 or More
+ -1 or More
? - 0 or 1
{3} - Exact number, in this case 3
{3,4} - Range of numbers (Minimum, Maximum)
[] - Matches characters in the bracket
[^ ] - Matches characters not in the bracket
| - either or
() - groups


\d{3}.\d{3}.\d{4} => The first and second parts of the match will look for exactly 3 digits followed by a . then the last exactly 4 digits
\d{3}[-.]\d{3}[-.]\d{4} is the SAME as \d\d\d[-.]\d\d\d[-.]\d\d\d\d  


An example list

cat
mat
pat
bat

If you want to match everything it 'at' at the end but not bat

[^b]at  => The pattern will exclude 'b' from the matched values

If you want everything that ends with a 'at'

[a-z A-Z]at

Example 2

Mr. Schafer
Mr Smith
Ms Davis
Mrs. Robinson
Mr. T

Match all words in the list that have 'Mr' in them

ANS = Mr\.?\s[A-Z]\w* => the latter tells the regex engine to march all words starting with 'Mr' and they can be followed by one '.' or not
                      => It alls checks for a space after the first match followed by an Upper-case letter then matches any word after that
                      => we use '*' because that matches 0 or more words unlike + which matches 1 or more characters following the capital letter



GROUPS

Example

Mr. Schafer
Mr Smith
Ms Davis
Mrs. Robinson
Mr. T

Match the 'Ms' or 'Mrs'

Ans = M(s|rs)\.?\s[A-Z]\w* =>so we will be matchinf anything that starts with 'Ms' OR 'Mrs'

Matching emails

-- My attempt => [a-zA-Z0-9_.-+]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+

- It the beginning i am matching all characters from a-z A-Z and 0-9
- I am using the '+' to say I want to match one or more of anything in the character set []
- Then I check if the aforementioned are followed by one of more '@' sign using the
- Then I check for a [a-zA-Z] following the '@' symbol which will then be followed by a '.'


URL Example

https://www.google.com
http://antonyngayo.com
https://youtube.com
https://www.nasa.gov

Create a regex to match all the the URLS

ANS = https?://(www\.)?(\w+)\.(\w+)

https? => This matches both http and https as 's' is optional
(www\.)? => this group matches areas were 'www' is present, but also matches areas where it is missing
(\w+) => This create two other groups which are mandatory (domain name and top-level domain names)
