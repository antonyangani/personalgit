#Creating an IPSEC connection between 2 VPCs
-- The first action would be to create two PFSENSE servers for each VPC ( there is a cheatshet for that )
-- On each PFSENSE do the following
    -- Go to Interfaces > Assignments > VLANS > Add > parent interface (em1 lan)> VLAN Tag ( put the VLAN ID for the VPC network) > save 
    -- Go to Interface assignments > Add the newest addition 
    -- Go to interfaces > OPT1 > Change Description > IPV4 static > Give an IP that is within the VPC CIDR space e.g. 192.168.50.2 > Save
    -- Go to Firewall > Rules > Newly Created VPC > Allow ICMP protocol
    -- test if pfsense can reach VPC subnet

#Creating the IPSec connection
-- Go to VPN > IPSEC > Add P1 
-- key exchange version : IKEv1
-- Internet protocol: IPv4
-- Interface : WAN
-- Remote Gateway: 62.12.119.41 ( This is the IP to the other PFsense )
-- Description ( Give it a descriptive name )
-- Phase 1 Proposal ( Change only the: Preshared Key: M@w1ngu! )
-- Encryption ( AES, 28 bit, SHA1, 2( 1024 ) )
-- Lifetime: 86400
-- Save 

#Add Phase 2 ( Do on both PFSense servers )
-- Add phase 2
-- Local network ( IP of the local VPC e.g. 192.168.50.0/26 )
-- Remote Network ( IP of the remote VPC e.g. 10.150.150.0/26 )
-- Description ( Give a suitable name )
-- Encryption Algorithm ( AES only )
-- Hash Algorithm ( SHA1 )
-- PFS key group ( OFF )
-- Lifetime: 86400
-- Save

#Check whether an IPSEC tunnel is established
-- Status > IPSec > Connect ( If it successful, it will establish )

#To make the VMs communicate 

-- Go to Firewall > RULES > IPSEC
-- Add > Protocol (ICMP) > Source Network ( The IP of the remote Subnet e.g. 10.150.150.0/26)
-- Destination ( ANTONYVPC2 ) > Save 
-- Add > Protocol ( TCP ) > Source Network ( IP of remote subnet )
-- Destination ( ANTONYVPC2 )
-- Save ( Do for both PFsenses )

#Add routes to VM
-- Login to the VM
-- ensure route is installed
-- type: ip route add 10.150.150.0/26 via 192.168.50.2 dev eth0
-- in case you need to delete the above ( ip route del 192.168.50.0/26 )
-- try pinging a vm on the remote subnet
