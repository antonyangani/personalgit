#Resizing filesystem without using LVM
-- Say you have a VM with a mounted partition of 100G which is full
-- lsblk # Get partition info

#IN CENTOS 7
-- yum install cloud-utils-growpart
-- umount /mnt/partition_name
-- growfs /dev/sdb 1 # this will imply grow /dev/sdb1
== IF FS was XFS
-- xfs_growfs /dev/sdb1
-- mount /mnt/partition_name

== IF FS was EXT4
-- resize2fs /dev/sdb1
