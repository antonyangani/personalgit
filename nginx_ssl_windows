#RENEWING SSL FOR Salamafikira

-- I got the .zip from namecheap via mail
-- I downloaded the .zip folder from namecheap and unzipped on my local computer
-- Then, I combined the .crt and .ca-bundle files as shown below The order of the files is paramount
-- cat sfbreathe_com.crt sfbreathe_com.ca-bundle >> sfnginx.cert
-- I took the resultant file  sfnginx.cert and put it in the D:\ssl\nginx\ folder in the client's server
-- I restarted the nginx service via services.msc in windows run
