#USING MOLECULE TO CREATE ROLES
-- create a virtual environment 
    virtualenv {foldername} using python 3
-- pip install molecule docker
-- molecule init role --role-name ansible-role-redis --driver-name docker

=> the above create a directory with boilerplate for creating roles

e.g. ansible-role-redis

#Creating ROLES
-- cd /etc/ansible/roles => ALL ROLES NEED TO BE IN THE ROLES FOLDER/DIR
-- ansible-galaxy init {rolename}  --offline

=> The above command will some dirs and files

#Defaults
-- It stores the data about the application. Some Default variables can be stored here
#Files
-- Static files can be stored here, files to be sent to remote machines
#Handlers
-- These are task directive/triggers to notify and subscribe 
e.g. In case a conf file changes, it should trigger service restart
#Meta
-- Contains basic info about the role e.g. author name, platform supported, and dependencies
#Tasks
-- This will contain the core logic e.g. installing packages e.t.c
#Templates
-- These are dynamic files which can be modified as needed, and it is written in ginger2 templating language
#Vars
-- Both VARS and DEFAULTS store variables. BUT variables stored in VARS have a high priority and cannot be overwritten


#INVENTORY
-- The default host for ansible is under /etc/ansible/hosts
-- You can create custom inventories e.g. in the root folder
-- e.g.

-- touch /root/ansiblehostfile
-- vim !!
[ a server group ]
SOME_IP_ADDRESSES

-- close
-- ansible -i /root/ansiblehostfile group_name -m shell -a "uptime"

# Checking Server INFO using ANSIBLE MODULE

-- ansible ubuntu -i inventory/kubernetes -m setup


#Installing packages from the CLI without a playbook

-b = become
-m  = module e.g. apt, yum, command (The latter is the default if not specified otherwise)
-a = arguments
ubuntu = this is the group I am targetting in the inventory

-- ansible ubuntu -i inventory/kubernetes -b -m apt -a "name=ntp state=present"

#INSTALLING MARIADB and configuring a user + database

-- ansible ubuntu -i inventory/kubernetes -b -m apt -a "name=epel-release state=present"
-- ansible ubuntu -i inventory/kubernetes -b -a "sudo apt update"
-- ansible ubuntu -i inventory/kubernetes -b -m apt -a "name=mariadb-server state=present"

#Creating user groups
-- ansible -i inventory/linode linode -b -m group -a "name=admin state=present"
#ADD user
-- ansible -i inventory/linode linode -b -m user -a "name=johndoe group=admin createhome=yes"

#Running AD-HOC commands in the background
-B = Background
-p = Polling (Check on the program after a certain amount of time)
-- ansible -i inventory/linode linode -b -B 3600 -P 0 -a "apt -y update"

The command will return an ansible jobID for tracking which can be used as follows:
-- ansible -i inventory/linode linode -b -m async_status -a "jid={ID}" e.g. 922641063986.1675099

#Having ansble playbook ask for root password

--  ansible-playbook -i inventory/linode mysql.yml --ask-become-pass
