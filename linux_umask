#What is UMASK
-- This is a setting of a mask that controls how permissions are set on newly created files (both dirs and files)
-- ROOT has umask (0022) 
-- to understand how permissions are going to be given, you subtract 0777 - 0022  = 0755 


-- Other user have umask of 0002 => 0777 - 0002 = 0775
