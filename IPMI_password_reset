hey again :)
... i think what is happening with the password for the esxi is that a lockout rule is activating and thus locking us out... after some research, i realise that we don't have to reboot the host to have the password working again... to reset the lockout and thus granting access again via ssh or the web UI, login to the host via the direct console access (login to the host via IPMI, launch the remote console, press f2 to enter system configuration - the user is root and password is the root password which you already have-, go to Troubleshooting Options,  Select Enable ESXi Shell, Press CTRL+ALT+F1 and then at the ESXi shell login with root and the password that you already have) then run these commands. To show number of failed attempts:  pam_tally2 --user root
 to unlock the root account: pam_tally2 --user root --reset

after that, try to login in again... to leave this console, enter exit on terminal and press CTRL + ALT + F2....PS: i tried it and it works...no need to reboot the host

i think  a permanent solution would be to have this on private IP like how our hosts (172.16.0.5 and .4 are) seeing as there are so many attempts to brute force it (25 attacks in less than 20 minutes since i last reset the lockout)
